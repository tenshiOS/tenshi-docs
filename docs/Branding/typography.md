# Typography & Subtitles

We emulate a refined look using built‑in GitBook options (no custom CSS required).

- Use **Accent color** from `Branding & Theme` for a soft pink UI.  
- Titles are `# H1`; subtitles are placed right under titles as `<small><em>…</em></small>`.  
- Insert a divider `---` after the subtitle to create hierarchy.  
- Prefer sentence‑case headings and short lead paragraphs.
