# Security

Tenshi respects users' security:  

- No custody of private keys—only wallet signatures for tier access.  
- Simulations are **indicative only**, not trade execution.  
- Data is served via read-only GraphQL subgraphs and LLM outputs—nothing is mutable.  

**Trust, transparency, clarity.**
